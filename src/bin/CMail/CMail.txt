MANDATORY OPTIONS 

-host:[user:pass@]host[:port]  Specifies the SMTP server to be used to deliver 
                               the message. A username and password may 
                               optionally be specified for SMTP authentication.
                               Supported mechanisms are CRAM-MD5, PLAIN, and 
                               LOGIN (in order of preference). This setting 
                               cannot be used with -file. 

-file:filename                 Specifies a file name to write the constructed 
                               e-mail message to instead of sending it via 
                               SMTP. This setting cannot be used with -host. 

-from:address[:alias]          Specifies the e-mail address, with optional 
                               alias, to appear in the 'From' header of the 
                               message. This setting is required. 

RECIPIENTS 

-to:address[:alias[:DSN]]      Adds a recipient to appear in the 'To' field of 
                               the message. This setting may be specified 
                               multiple times. See 'Recipient Management' for 
                               more information. 

-cc:address[:alias[:DSN]]      As above, for CC recipients. 

-bcc:address[::DSN]            As above, for BCC recipients. 

-reply-to:address[:alias]      Specifies the e-mail address to which replies 
                               should be sent. 

CONTENT CONTROL 

-subject:subject text          Specifies the message subject (literal string). 

-body:message body             Specifies the message body. Note: 
                               '\\','\r','\n', and '\t' are valid escape codes.

-body-file:filename            Specifies a file containing the message body. 

-body-64                       Use base64 encoding for the message body. 

-body-qp                       Use quoted-printable encoding for the message 
                               body. 

-body-html:filename            Specifies a file name containing a UTF-8 encoded
                               HTML body. Attached images can be referred to 
                               using their Content-ID if attached using -ai. 

-charset:charset               Specifies the character set for the plain 
                               message body. The default is US-ASCII. Implies 
                               -mime. 

-head:header:value             Add the specified header and header value to the
                               message. This option may be specified multiple 
                               times. E.g. -head:X-No-Archive:Yes. 

-mime                          Force use of MIME for the message body in 
                               messages having no attachments. 

-priority:n                    Set the message priority to 'n', 1 = Highest, 2 
                               = High, 4 = Low, 5 = Lowest. This is simply a 
                               shortcut to set the widely supported X-Priority 
                               header. 

-smtp-transparency             When writing output to files, this repeats the 
                               first character on the line if it is '.'. Use 
                               this if the output files are to be sent via an 
                               SMTP server without further interpretation. 

--                             Read message body from stdin. 

ATTACHMENTS 

-a:filename                    Attach the specified file. CMail will select 
                               base64 or quoted-printable encoding 
                               automatically. Files containing >85% ASCII text 
                               in the first 4kB will be quoted-printable 
                               encoded. 

-a64:filename                  Attach the specified file using base64 encoding.

-aqp:filename                  Attach the specified file using quoted-printable
                               encoding. 

-ai:filename                   Creates an inline (multipart/related) 
                               attachment, usually used for images referenced 
                               in a HTML message body. The Content-ID is based 
                               on the file name (URL encoded) and from domain, 
                               with the resulting URL in the form 
                               cid:image.jpg@example.com. Requires -body-html. 

-auu:filename                  Attach the specified file using uuencoding. 
                               These attachments are encoded within the message
                               body. 

-ayenc:filename                Attach the specified file using yEnc encoding. 
                               Note, yEnc encoding will most likely result in 
                               RFC violations in the output stream and should 
                               never be used on public mail systems. These 
                               attachments are encoded within the message body.

-awild:options:pattern[/...]   Attach multiple files matching one or more 
                               patterns. See 'Wildcard Attachments' below. 

DELIVERY STATUS NOTIFICATION (DSN) / MESSAGE DISPOSITION NOTIFICATION (MDN) 

-dsn:options                   Specifies the default DSN types to request if no
                               DSN settings are specified for the recipient, 
                               using the first letter of each DSN type. 
                               Acceptable values are (S)uccess, (F)ailure, 
                               (D)elay, and (N)ever. E.g. -dsn:SFD will request
                               a DSN for success, failure and delay. If (N)ever
                               is included in the list, it will take precedence
                               over all other values. 

-dsnid:id                      Sets the envelope ID for DSN requests. This ID 
                               is included in any DSN responses from mail 
                               servers. If not set, a random ID will be used. 

-mdn                           Request MDN (read receipt). 

CONNECTION CONTROL 

-4                             Force the use of IPv4. 

-6                             Force the use of IPv6. 

-authtypes:type[,type...]      A comma-separated list of authentication types 
                               which may be used with the upstream server. 
                               Supported values are CRAM-MD5, PLAIN, and LOGIN.

-helo:hostname                 Use the specified hostname in HELO/EHLO. 

-proxy:[user:pass@]host[:port] Connect via a proxy. Authentication is only 
                               supported for HTTPS proxies. 

-proxytype:type                Specify the type of proxy being connected to. 
                               Supported proxy types are SOCKS (default proxy 
                               type, default port 1080), and HTTPS (default 
                               port 8080). 

DEBUGGING 

-d                             Debug mode, show data to and from the server. 

COMMAND LINE ONLY 

-config:filename               Apply the configuration from the specified file.

-nodefault                     Do not apply settings from the default 
                               cmail.conf. 

-skipnofile                    By default CMail checks attachments exist before
                               sending the e-mail, and exits if they do not. 
                               This option disables this check. Note that 
                               e-mail will still be sent even if one or more 
                               attachments is deleted after this check, as 
                               CMail dynamically creates messages during the 
                               SMTP session. 

CONFIGURATION 

CMail applies configuration options from a default configuration file, a 
command line specified configuration file, and from the command line itself, in
that order. Settings for which multiple values can be assigned (E.g. to) are 
ADDED from each configuration. For settings that can only be specified once, 
the last occurance will be used. I.e. You can specify a default configuration 
in cmail.conf, and overide settings for individual messages by specifying 
another config file, or via the command line. 

The default configuration is stored in %APPDATA%\cmail.conf. 

Configuration files must contain one setting per line, and do not include the 
'-' prefix. 

RECIPIENT MANAGEMENT 

The -to, -cc, and -bcc settings each add a recipient to the message. These 
settings each take one to three parameters. The first specifies the e-mail 
address, and is required. The second parameter can be used to specify an alias,
usually the name of the recipient. The alias may be quoted (using double 
quotes, escaped as necessary), although this is only required where a colon may
be present in the alias. The final parameter specifies DSN options for the 
recipent, using the same format as the -dsn option documented above. E.g. 
-to:user@example.com:"Example User":DF. Where an alias is not desired (or not 
applicable in the case of BCC), this field may be left blank. E.g. 
-bcc:user@example.com::SFD. 

WILDCARD ATTACHMENTS 

CMail supports adding multiple attachments from a source directory using 
patterns. Multiple patterns may be specified, separated by '/', and are 
evaluated from left to right. Patterns may include standard wildcard characters
'*' or '?', and character sets and ranges [], and may be prefixed with a 
logical NOT operator '!'. In addition to the patterns, a number of options are 
available to modify the behaviour. 

Options: (Case sensitive) 

H - Include hidden files 
S - Include system files 
A - Include ONLY files with the Archive attribute set 
R - Recursive (include files in subdirectories) 
C - Case sensitive matching 
U - Use uuencoding 
6 - Use base64 encoding 
Q - Use quoted-printable encoding 
I - Create inline attachments for use with -body-html 

E.g. To recursively include logs from 1970, but exclude any .tmp files, you 
could do the following -awild:R:c:\logs\1970*/!*.tmp
